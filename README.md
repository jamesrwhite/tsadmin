tsadmin
========

Get a realtime overview of your MySQL servers. Very much a work in progress.

Why 'tsadmin'
--------------

I'm not exactly sure where this name came from originally. There is an internal tool
with the same name as this that we use at [Miniclip](http://www.miniclip.com/) that
is probably almost as old as the company itself. It's very detailed and gets used a lot
but the code behind it is pretty scary, hence this.

TODO:
-----

- [ ] Reads/Writes per second
- [ ] Replication lag
- [ ] More detailed connection stats (per second & aborts)
- [ ] Sortable columns
- [ ] Groups/clusters
- [ ] Master detection
